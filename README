Staticfy
========

Staticfy provides an easy solution to convert entire sites into static html/javascript/css files. Sure, any dynamic things like search or contact forms will not work. But it can be still a useful tool.

Staticfy still on development, current realeases are just beta ones, but feel free to use if you want.

Instalation
-----------

Simple install the gem.

    gem install staticfy

Command Line Usage
------------------

Currently staticfy only accepts simple crawling, more complex things will be enabled in future versions.

For now you need to create a folder called `output` and run:

    staticfy http://mysite.com
